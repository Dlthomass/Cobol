# Cobol
Cobol basic program passed in Open Cobol IDE
hi, all these programs I have done was from a website http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/examples/default.htm
txtup is a .txt file I created for the local read. Data is a sequential file from IBM open project Cobol course, with packed decimal and special foramt which leads to be unreadable. Will try to learn how to learn it by myself.
